You need following packages in the JS version to execute it:

1) Install Git according to your Operating System from:
https://git-scm.com/downloads

Run the following commands:

2) npm install express
3) npm install aws-sdk
4) npm install multer

5) Finally run this command in your console: 
  node do_script.js

  If you're seeing the message "App listening at: http://localhost:3000" after running node do_script.js, it means your Node.js application is successfully running
  and is now listening for requests on port 3000. This is a good sign and indicates your server setup is correct. 
  
  Open a Web Browser: Launch any web browser of your choice.
  Enter URL: In the address bar of the browser, type http://localhost:3000 and press Enter.
  This directs the browser to communicate with your running Node.js application.
