# Enhanced Digital Asset Management for PHP and Node.js

We are elevating the management of digital assets within our projects by integrating functionality that allows for the efficient upload of images, PDFs, and videos directly to a cloud-based Digital Space. This shift from embedding assets within our codebase to a more dynamic, cloud-based storage model is designed to streamline processes, improve scalability, and ensure a seamless experience across different platforms.

This enhancement is specifically crafted for systems utilizing a PHP backend as well as Node.js/Express-based desktop applications, aiming to provide a unified and optimized approach to digital asset handling.

## External Storage Solution: Digital Ocean Spaces

To facilitate this upgrade, we've chosen Digital Ocean Spaces for our external storage needs. Digital Ocean Spaces offers an intuitive, scalable solution for storing and managing data, utilizing 'buckets' for logical data grouping. 

**Pricing Details:**
- **Cost:** $5 per month for each bucket
- **Storage Provided:** 250GB

This pricing model ensures affordability while providing ample space for your digital assets.

## Available Code

To aid in the implementation and adoption of this enhancement, the complete codebase is shared on my GitHub profile. This resource is intended to be a comprehensive guide, helping others to integrate similar functionalities into their projects.

## Pre-Requisites

Ensure you have the following installed and configured on your system to utilize this code effectively:

- Composer
- Git
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Multer (for handling file uploads)
- aws-sdk (for interacting with Digital Ocean Spaces)

## Digital Ocean Configuration

Before integrating the code, set up your Space on Digital Ocean with the following details:

- **Space (Bucket) Name:** [Your Bucket Name Here]
- **Secret Key:** [Your Secret Key Here]
- **Access Key (Public):** [Your Public Key Here]
- **Region:** [Your Region Here]

This information is crucial for configuring the connection between your application and Digital Ocean Spaces, ensuring secure and efficient asset management.
